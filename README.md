# machinelearning

I am currently begining my path into data science. 
As long as I keep learning more algorithms and find interesting databasets I will keep posting study cases. If you are in the same journey as me hope you find this scripts useful

For now there is only one about classification, I am looking forward to prepare some others about 
- Unsupervised Learning. To discover patterns
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing
- Deep Learning
....


The Classification file is an study case to predict cancer tumors.

The Artificial Neural Networks is a file to predict the output/production in MW of a combined cycle power plant.
